# 1. Accustoming yourself to C++

## Rule 01: View C++ as a federation of languages



## Rule 02: Prefer `const`, `enum`, and `inline` to `#define`



## Rule 03: Use `const` wherever possible

# 2. Constructions, Destructions, and Assignment Operators

## Rule 05: Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls



## Rule 06: Explicitly disallow the use of compiler-generated functions you do not want



## Rule 07: Declare destructions virtual in polymorphic base classes



## Rule 08: Prevent exceptions from leaving destructions



## Rule 09: Never call virtual functions during construction or destruction



## Rule 10: Have assignment operators return s reference to `*this`



## Rule 11: Handle assignment to self in operator=



## Rule 12: Copy all parts of an object
